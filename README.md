It is no secret that the apparel industry, specifically “fast fashion” is one of the  worst polluters on the planet.  Our goal is to create a standard of certification that not only compiles, but adds to, existing international standards regarding 6 key areas in the apparel industry in order to begin to put more sustainable standards and processes in place.

1.	Materials
2.	Process
3.	Storage & Shipping
4.	Environmental Impact
5.	Worker Conditions
6.	Social Responsibility

We propose to incentivize the Final Product Manufacturer to provide transparency and accountability to their upstream supply partners.  We plan to do this in two ways.

1.	 The Good Shepard Certification- This allows them to market their product as “premium” as well as making them attractive to conscientious focused demographics
2.	 A special tag issues upon certification that provides detailed info about their products life cycle.  This includes a 2d scanner that enables the consumer to access the Good Shepard Certification history of their product (transparency) as well as including a blue-tooth accessible strip to track washes and travel(ideal for luxury/ second had markets).
